# Hey there, I'm Murilo ðŸ‘‹

Since I was a child, I fed a huge curiosity about how things happen in a computer, so during my teenage days I've become the boy who would format computers and set up routers for the family, more and more I felt aroused into knowing what happens on the background. This thirst for knowledge made me go to a lot of incredible schools like MasterTech, Digital House, Codenation and Gama Academy which contributed into training the developer I am today.

- ðŸ”­Â Â Â Â Iâ€™m currently working at [Paypal](https://github.com/paypal) as an Integration Engineer and at [Digital House](https://github.com/DigitalHouseBrasil) as a Full Stack Professor.

- :rocket:Â Â Â Â Passionate about programming, technology and teaching. 

- :coffee:Â Â Â Â Wanna have some coffee? Feel free to reach me at murilohsignacio@gmail.com.
